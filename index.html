    <h1>The History of Animation</h1>
    <p>  In the early 1900's, Emily Cohl created the very first true animated film called <i>Fantasmagorie.</i>At the time chalkboard characters were popular on vaudevilles circuits, so the drawings were filmed in negative to give the animation the apperance of a chalkboard drawing brought to life.</p>
		
	<p>In 1915, Max Fleischer developed the rotoscope technique, where projection equipment is used to trace figures from stills of live-action footage. This method allowed animators to get a better understanding of the finer aspects of a moving form to create realistic, fluid motion in animated pieces. Fleischer's patent on rotoscoping expired in 1934, allowing other animators to swoop in and freely use the technique.</p>

			<h2>2D</h2>
      <p>2D animation is doing lots of drawings a little different every time. By doing this looking at the picture it makes the image look like it's moving. This moves at 24 frames per second and has been around for thousands of years.</p>

			<h2>Stop Motion</h2>
		<p>Stop motion is an animated filmmaking technique in which objects are physically manipulated in small increments between individually photographed frames so that they will appear to exhibit independent motion or change when the series of frames is played back</p>
